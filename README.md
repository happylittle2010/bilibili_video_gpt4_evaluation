## 模仿《红楼梦》的风格翻译《1984》节选内容

这是小说《1984》的节选内容：

CHAPTER 2  As he put his hand to the door-knob Winston saw that he had left the diary open on the table. DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written all over it, in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room. It was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done. But, he realized, even in his panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet.  He drew in his breath and opened the door. Instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him. A colourless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair and a lined face, was standing outside.  ‘Oh, comrade,’ she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, ‘I thought I heard you come in. Do you think you could come across and have a look at our kitchen sink? It’s got blocked up and——’  It was Mrs Parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same floor. (’Mrs’ was a word somewhat discountenanced by the Party—you were supposed to call everyone ‘comrade’—but with some women one used it instinctively.) She was a woman of about thirty, but looking much older. One had the impression that there was dust in the creases of her face. Winston followed her down the passage. These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation. Victory Mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were falling to pieces. The plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls, the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not closed down altogether from motives of economy. Repairs, except what you could do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees which were liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two years.

红藕香残玉簟秋。轻解罗裳，独上兰舟。云中谁寄锦书来？雁字回时，月满西楼。花自飘零水自流。一种相思，两处闲愁。此情无计可消除，才下眉头，却上心头。——宋代·李清照《一剪梅·红藕香残玉簟秋》
昨夜雨疏风骤，浓睡不消残酒。试问卷帘人，却道海棠依旧。知否，知否？应是绿肥红瘦。——宋代·李清照《如梦令·昨夜雨疏风骤》

Demonstration of a superconducting diode-with-memory, operational at zero magnetic field with switchable nonreciprocity
Abstract
Diode is one of the basic electronic components. It has a nonreciprocal current response, associated with a broken space/time reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate prototypes of superconducting diodes operational at zero magnetic field. They are based on conventional niobium planar Josephson junctions, in which space/time symmetry is broken by a combination of self-field effect from nonuniform bias and stray fields from a trapped Abrikosov vortex. We demonstrate that nonreciprocity of critical current in such diodes can reach an order of magnitude and rectification efficiency can exceed 70%. Furthermore, we can easily change the diode polarity and switch nonreciprocity on/off by changing the bias configuration and by trapping/removing of a vortex. This facilitates a memory functionality. We argue that such a diode-with-memory can be used for a future generation of in-memory superconducting computers.

Introduction
Large computation facilities, such as big data centers and supercomputers have become major energy consumers with a power budget often in excess of 100 MW. It has been argued that a small fraction of this power would be sufficient for cooling down the facility to cryogenic temperatures, suitable for operation of superconductors (SC)1. SC electronics would not only enable effective utilization of energy by removing resistive losses, it could also greatly enhance the operation speed. Since there is no resistance, R = 0, the RC time constant is no longer a limiting factor. The ultimate operation frequency is determined by the SC energy gap. For many SCs it is in the THz range2. This enables clock frequencies several orders of magnitude higher than for modern semiconducting electronics. Such perspectives has lead to a renewed interest in development of a digital SC computer1,3,4,5,6,7.

Diode is one of the primary electronic components. Its nonreciprocal current–voltage (I–V) characteristics allow rectification of alternating currents, which is necessary for signal processing and ac–dc conversion. Diodes can be also used as building blocks for Boolean logics in digital computation. SC diodes should have strongly asymmetric critical currents, ∣Ic+∣ ≠ ∣Ic−∣. It is well known that nonreciprocity may appear in spatially asymmetric SC devices8,9. SC diodes, based on spatially nonuniform Josephson junctions (JJs), were demonstrated long time ago10. Also SC ratchets11, rectifying motion of either Josephson12,13,14,15 or Abrikosov16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 vortices, were intensively studied. However, such spatially asymmetric devices operate only at finite magnetic fields, while computer components should work at zero field. Nonreciprocity at H = 0 is prohibited by the time-reversal symmetry, which requires invariance of electromagnetic characteristics upon simultaneous flipping of current and magnetic field10,24. Therefore, zero-field SC diode requires breaking of both space and time-reversal symmetry.

Recently it was shown that nonreciprocity can be induced in noncentrosymmetric SC by spin–orbit interaction (SOI)25,26,27,28,29. This renewed search for diode effects in noncentrosymmetric SC25,29,30,31 and heterostructures32,33,34. SOI can induce asymmetry of either resistance in the fluctuation region near Tc25,26,27,29,31,35, or supercurrent at low T32,33,36,37,38,39,40. However, SOI-based diodes require significant magnetic field. In several works zero-field SC diode operation was reported34,37, involving additional nontrivial effects. In this respect, nonreciprocity can be a tool for investigation of unconventional SC35,36,37,38,39,40.

In this work, we demonstrate prototypes of SC diodes with a large and switchable nonreciprocity of supercurrent at zero magnetic field. They are made of a conventional Nb SC and contain cross-like planar Josephson junctions with additional electrodes and an artificial vortex trap. Nonreciprocity is induced by a combination of self-field effect from asymmetric bias and stray fields from trapped Abrikosov vortex (AV). We demonstrate that the ratio, ∣Ic+/Ic−∣, of such diodes can reach an order of magnitude and rectification efficiency can exceed 70%. Furthermore, we can switch nonreciprocity on and off, as well as change diode polarity in one and the same device. This is achieved by trapping/removing either a vortex, or an antivortex, and/or by changing the bias configuration. This facilitates memory functionality. We argue that such a diode-with-memory can be used for a new generation of superconducting in-memory computers.

Results
The concept
We consider the simplest case of a short JJ with the length L < 4λJ, where λJ is the Josephson penetration depth. This allows neglecting of complex phenomena associated with screening effects and Josephson vortices9,10,41. Realization of zero-field SC diode requires breaking of space/time symmetry. Time-reversal leads to inversion of transport currents and magnetic fields generated by these currents. The role of an external field, H, is somewhat more tricky24. However, since it induces a spatial phase gradient in a JJ, it is connected with the spatial symmetry41.

Our concept has two simple ingredients: (i) Utilization of a nonuniform bias for achieving nonreciprocity at finite fields10; and (ii) Shifting it to zero field by persistent stray fields from a trapped AV41,42,43. These effects are summarized in Fig. 1a and b. Here black lines represent the conventional Fraunhofer modulation of the critical current versus magnetic flux, Ic(Φ), for a uniform JJ without a vortex. In this case, there are both time-reversal, Ic+(H) = ∣Ic−(H)∣, and space-reversal, Ic±(H) = Ic±( − H), symmetries.

## 数学题求解程序

你是一个数学题求解程序，你可以对一道数学题进行分析推理，但由于你的计算能力非常弱，所以你每次在求解一道数学题时，先进行分析推理，当遇到需要计算的步骤时，调用calculator API来替代你完成计算步骤（非常简单的计算不需要调用API）。**调用calculator API后，立即停止输出**。

例如：
1.$(1-\frac{y}{x} )(x+y)^{8} $的展开式中$x^{2} y^{6} $的系数为？
我们先展开原式：
$(1-\frac{y}{x} )(x+y)^{8}  = (x+y)^{8}-\frac{y}{x}(x+y)^{8}$
然后我们就可以根据二项式定理求出$x^{2} y^{6} $的系数：
<LatexExpression = "$(x+y)^{8}-\frac{y}{x}(x+y)^{8}$" Option = "用二项式定理求原式展开式中$x^{2} y^{6} $的系数">

2.若一元二次方程$x^{2} +x-c=0$没有实数根，则c的取值范围是？
由于方程没有实数根，所以判别式$\Delta$ 小于0。
<LatexExpression = "$x^{2} +x-c=0$" Option = "求方程的判别式$\Delta$">

3.解不等式组$2x-1\ge 1,\frac{1+x}{3}<  x-1$
我们只需分别求出两个不等式的中x的取值范围，然后求出两个不等式的交集即可：
<LatexExpression = "$2x-1\ge 1$" Option = "化简不等式">
<LatexExpression = "$\frac{1+x}{3}<  x-1$" Option = "化简不等式">

4.已知函数$f(x)=e^{x} -ax$和$g(x)=ax-\ln x$有相同的最小值. 求$a$.
首先，我们需要找到$f(x)$和$g(x)$的最小值。为此，我们可以分别对它们求导，然后令导数等于零。
<LatexExpression = "$f(x)=e^{x} -ax$" Option="求f(x)的导数">
<LatexExpression = "$g(x)=ax-\ln x$" Option="求g(x)的导数">

5.已知矩阵$A = \begin{Bmatrix}1 & 2 & -6\\1 & 0 & -3\\1 & 1 & -4\end{Bmatrix}$，求A的Jordan标准型和e^{At} .

6.（此处放你的题目）
